Event driven and on demand Nginx front end proxy cache purge utility.

== Description ==

A flexible and customizable event driven cache purge plugin to work in conjuction with Nginx configured as a front end proxy to a WordPress install. For use with either single WP sites or in a WP network. If you have a single WP site without custom post types or mobile support the [Nginx Proxy Cache Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nginx-proxy-cache-purge/) is simpler and will probably meet your needs.

*	purge taxonomy archives
*	processing specific to post type and status
*	7 filters for customizing purge behavior (see guide under Installation tab)
*	on demand purge post action link
*	mobile caching support
*	auto detects WPtouch/WPtouch Pro for mobile cache purging
*	works in both networks and single sites
*	includes `ranpcp_purge_urls( $array_of_urls )` function for custom purging by other plugins
